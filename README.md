Labyrinth Cpp
--------------------
This folder Contains 3 different steps I used to create small Labyrinth game using SDL Library. Each part of this project has a .exe file that can be used to see the final result without the need to compile the files. Finally, this is my original work back in 2010.

Generation:
--------------
By itself, Generation, is a separate project. Using OOP paradigmn I created this project so as to automatically generate a perfect Labyrinth. This latter, part is a labyrinth that has one and only one path to the destination. The generation algorithm was mainly based on "https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mod%C3%A9lisation_math%C3%A9matique_de_labyrinthe" especially the "Exploration exhaustive" part.

SDL test:
------------
This part's objective was to create some static environment and test the functionalities, Creating the game's environment and Controlling the character.

Final version:
----------------
Just like the name says, this is the final version where the two privious versions are combined to create a the Cpp SDL labyrinth.
